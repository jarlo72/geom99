                <article>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Ideal Solution</h3> 
                        <p> Nature-seekers can explore the Southern end of the Vancouver Island Trail and can make informed decisions to maximize their experience.
                        </p>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Reality</h3> 
                        <p> There are currently no applications where people can access the Vancouver Island Trail map and information on trail segments.
                            The Vancouver Island Trail Association (VITA) has a published website containing PDF and GPX files of trail maps and written descriptions of trail
                            segments posted to their website. 
                        </p>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Consequences</h3> 
                        <p> Without accessible information about the trail, people may be apprehensive or discouraged to hike on the trail if the information on the trail is incomplete. 
                            This may also hinder a users's ability to prepare for their hike on the Vancouver Island Trail adequately. This is especially true for those planning a multi-day 
                            through hike where preparation is key.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Proposal Solution</h3> 
                        <p> A web-based GIS solution that will incorporate open-source ESRI (ArcGIS Online) functionality to build a trail map, in the form of a Story Map to give a prospective 
                            hikers a guided tour and an interactive Map using ArcGIS API for JavaScript to give a self-guided tour through the southern end of the trail.
