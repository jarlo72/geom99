                <h2 class="projectTitle">Vancouver Island Trail Map Overview</h2>
                <article>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Project Background</h3> 
                        <p> The Vancouver Island Trail Association is a not-for-profit organization based in Victoria, British Columbia. The association has developed 98% of the 800-kilometre Vancouver Island Trail, spanning the
                            entirety of Vancouver Island, from Victoria to Cape Scott. The association hopes to connect communities and foster an environment of inquisitive exploration amongst tourists, hikers and
                            nature enthusiasts alike. Lately, they have needed to increase the accessibility of their trail maps and data in hopes of better informing prospective
                            and actual hikers of the trail. Their current map offerings consist of static maps which do not reflect the latest trail developments. This project aims to address this need.

                    <h3 class="underlineTitle">Problem Statement</h3>
                    <div><h4>Ideal</h4> 
                        <p> Nature-seekers can explore the Southern end of the Vancouver Island Trail and can make informed decisions to maximize their experience.
                        </p></div>
                    <div><h4>Reality</h4> 
                        <p> There is currently no application where people can access the Vancouver Island trail maps and information together in a convenient manner.
                            At the moment, the Vancouver Island Trail Association (VITA) has a website that contains only PDF and GPX files of different trail maps and written descriptions about
                            the trail, making it repetitive and tedious to use.
                        </p></div>
                    <div><h4>Consequences</h4> 
                        <p> Without accessible information oabout the trail, apprehensive people may be discouraged to hike on the trail or hinder one's ability to prepare for their hike adequately.
                            This is especially true for those planning a multi-day hike where preparation is essential.
                        </p></div>
                    <div><h4>Proposed Solution</h4> 
                        <p> A web-based GIS solution that will incorporate open-source Esri (ArcGIS Online) functionality to build a trail map of the southern portion of the Vancouver
                            Island trail in the form of a StoryMap to give prospective hikers a guided tour and an interactive map using ArcGIS API for JavaScript as a self-guided tour.
