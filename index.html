                <h2 class="projectTitle">Vancouver Island Trail Web Application</h2>
                <article>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Ideal Solution</h3> 
                        <p> Nature-seekers can explore the Southern end of the Vancouver Island Trail and can make informed decisions to maximize their experience.
                        </p>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Existing Supports for User Access to Trail Information</h3> 
                        <p> There are currently no applications where people can access the Vancouver Island Trail map and information on trail segments.
                            The Vancouver Island Trail Association has a published website containing pdf files of trail maps and written descriptions of trail
                            segments posted to their website. 
                        </p>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Pitfalls if No Solution is Created</h3> 
                        <p> The Vancouver Island Trail Association is a non-profit and volunteer run association that works to maintain the trails and promote trail
                            access to the general public. Currently, the Vancouver Island Trail is incomplete and the association requires funding to continue trail
                            construction and promote the trail as a unique trail to increase trail use and public engagement. Without accessible information about the trail,
                            people may be apprehensive or discouraged to hike on the trail if the information on the trail is incomplete. This may also hinder a users's ability
                            to prepare for their hike adequately, especially where the VITA promotes this trail as a system that experienced backpackers could hike over a
                            multi-day trip. A more thorough web application of the trail could also promote the trail and attract stakeholders who wish to fund the trail construction
                            and maintenance.

                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Proposal Solution</h3> 
                        <p> A web-based GIS solution that will incorporate open-source ESRI (ArcGIS Online) functionality to build a trail map, in the form of a story map to give a
                            prospective hikers a tour
