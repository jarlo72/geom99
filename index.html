                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Vancouver Island Trail Background</h3> 
                        <p> The Vancouver Island Trial Association is a non-for-profit organization based in Victoria, British Columbia. The association have developed 98% of the 800-kilometer Vancouver Island Trail, spanning the
                            entirety of Vancouver island, from Victoria to Cape Scott. The association hopes to connect communities and foster an environment of inquisitive exploration amoungst tourists, hikers and
                            nature-enthusiasts alike. As of late, they have had a need to increase the accessibility of their trail maps and data in hopes of better informing prospective
                            and actual hikers of the trail. Their current map offerings consist of static maps which do not reflect the latest trail developments. This project aims to address this need.

                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Ideal Solution</h3> 
                        <p> The ideal solution for hikers and nature-enthusiasts alike is to use an interactive and informed map about the different sections of the trail system that has
                            appropriate layers to support them to make informed decisions about planning their trip(s), essentially a web-GIS.
                        </p></div>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Reality</h3> 
                        <p> There is currently no Geographical Information System (GIS) where people can access a Vancouver Island Trail map that contains spatial layers that describe parts of the trail system.
                            At this moment, the Vancouver Island Trail Association (VITA) has a website that contains only PDF and GPX files of different trail maps and written descriptions about
                            the trail, making it repetitive and tedious to use.
                        </p></div>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Consequences</h3> 
                        <p> Without an interactive, updatable map, people may be apprehensive or discouraged to hike on the trail system if the information on the trail is incomplete. 
                            This may also hinder a users's ability to prepare for their hike on the Vancouver Island Trail adequately. This is especially true for those planning a multi-day 
                            hike where preparation is essential.
                        </p></div>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Proposal Solution</h3> 
                        <p> A web-based GIS solution that will incorporate open-source Esri (ArcGIS Online) functionality to build a trail map, in the form of a Story Map to give a prospective 
                            hikers a guided tour and an interactive Map using ArcGIS API for JavaScript to give a self-guided tour through the southern end of the trail.
