/*
    Before we get into things, a brief style guide reminder.
    Comments for communication use your full name, like in this one.
    For comments that need to stick around through the submission, initial and date.
    Please initial and date if you modify someone else's code, unless it's very minor.

    If you need to modify the CSS of an element for your page (ie, <h1>) make sure you
     use a Class or ID for it, so you don't break everyone else's page!
