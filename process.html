                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Topic Selection</h3> 
                        <p> The topic that was agreed upon is creating a Storymap and website based on the Vancouver Island Trail
                            System and information on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, built and monitored by the Vancouver
                            Island Trail Association (aka VITA for short).<br>The reason we've chose this topic was some of us in the
                            group had a similar direction in developing a web map from the provided data constructed via ArcGIS Pro
                            using doing analysis on them; same goes for the rest of the group as they are doing something similar with
                            ArcGIS Pro for their collaboration project. Therefore, the topic was a good match to move forward.
                        </p>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Gathering and Processing Data</h3> 
                        <p> Firstly, the data was extracted from VITA's website as they had the GPX files in store for use. After
                            aquiring the data, the next step was to get a raster file, specifaclly a DEM to show the different changes of
                            slope on and around the trail system. We have taken this from Geogratis as they had more complete elevation
                            data than VITA's on their website.<br>Afterwards, the data is analyzed to reduce the trail extent and ultimetely
                            show the southern side of the Vancouver Trail System as a specific focus for this project. The DEM was analyzed
                            and processed to make it presentable in a graph to show elevation changes and symbolised to make it visually
                            apleasing for the user when they view the Story Map portion of this project.
                        </p>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Web Interface Selection</h3> 
                        <p> The web interface portion of this project will contain all the background information and showcasing the Story Map
                            that we've made in the following three sections. Firstly, a home page/landing page that discusses the purpose of the
                            project, along with the Methedology and Process page (this page) that talks about the behind-the-scenes processes that
                            were taken to develop this project, and finally the solution page that showcases the Story Map and other soltions to
                            conclude this project.
                        </p>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph"><h3 class="underlineTitle">Creating Story Map</h3> 
                        <p> The process of creating the Story Map was challenging in a good way and tested our abilities to create a map with spatial
                            data and a good cartographic output making viewing enjoyable.
