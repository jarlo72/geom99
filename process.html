                        <p> Our project centers on the Vancouver Island Trail on Vancouver Island in British Columbia.  The trail is currently under construction
                            and is being promoted and monitored by the Vancouver Island Trail Association (aka VITA for short).
                            Some members of or group are working with VITA for their final collaborative work, and this project is a first blush of web map possibilities
                            for the trail.
                        </p>

                        <h3> Initial Overview</h3>
                        <p> VITA's website contains images of maps; there are no active interfaces for users and no capabilities for hikers to investigate sections of trails
                        for possible hikes.  VITA2022 therefore decided to focus on providing interactive web maps.  As described below, our <a href ="#first">first thought</a> was 
                        to do a web map with wildlife sightings and a link to weather forecasts. From there we proceeded to trying a <a href ="#second">second idea</a> and
                        <a href ="#third">third iteration</a>.
                        </p>

                    <div class="textZone">
                        <h3>First Concept</h3>
                        <p>The initial concept floated was a web-based GIS solution incorporating open-source data for both wildlife sightings and weather 
                             forecasts to make an informative and accessible web map of the Vancouver Island Trail.  A map, possibly derived from either 
                            Google Maps JavaScript API or Leaflet, would include pop-up information on geo-referenced wildlife sightings from
                            <a href = https://www.inaturalist.org/ > iNaturalist</a>, or possibly weather forecasts from <a href = https://openweathermap.org/ > OpenWeather Live</a>.
                            Base mapping data may also be sourced from <a href =https://www.openstreetmap.org/ > Open Street Maps</a>.<br>
                            Upon review of Google Maps, however, we realized the potential cost to our non-profit client would be prohibitive,
                            so our focus shifted to our <a href ="#second">second thought</a>, which was an alternative mapping option. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Second Concept</h3>
                        <p> We focused on using either Esri Leaflet or MapBox for the base map, stored on an ArcGIS server.  
                            However,  it was pointed out to us that the project scope was too large and we were advised to pull 
                            back our ambitions.  This led us to our <a href ="#third">third iteration</a> as outlined below. 
                        </p>  
                    </div>
                    <figure class="picBox">

                </article>

                    <div class = "textZone">
                        <h3>Third Concept</h3>
                        <p> The trail data was extracted from VITA's website in GPX format,  which was summarily brought into ArcGIS Pro and processed.  
                            A DEM was downloaded from the the federal government's GeoGratis portal as it had more complete elevation
                            data than the information on the VITA website. It too was added to ArcGIS Pro. The group decided to focus on the south portion of the trail.
                            The resulting map was published to Fleming's AGOL server.  <br>
                            Drawing on trail guide information extracted as .pdf data from VITA's website, an ArcGIS StoryMap was generated and published 
                            to the AGOL server to give users a guided tour of the south section of the trail. But the team was not satisfied with only one possible 
                            solution.  This led us to our <a href ="#fourth">fourth iteration</a>, another Esri product.

                        <p> A second web-based map was created using ArcGIS API for JavaScript; this was also published to 
                            AGOL.  This map allows users to carry out self-guided tours of the south sections of the trail. Numerous widgets were added:

                        <p> The web interface portion of this project will contain all the background information and showcasing the Story Map
                            that we've made in the following three sections. Firstly, a home page/landing page that discusses the purpose of the
                            project, along with the Methodology and Process page (this page) that talks about the behind-the-scenes processes that
                            were taken to develop this project, and finally the solution page that showcases the Story Map and other solutions to
                            conclude this project.

                        <p> The process of creating the Story Map was challenging in a good way and tested our abilities to create a map with spatial
                            data and a good cartographic output making viewing enjoyable.

                            that cannot be achieved through the StoryMaps Map itself.
