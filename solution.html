                        <p> The first solution we've produced to showcase the Vancouver Island trail system is an interactive Story Map
                            which discusses the southern part of the trail system from the Clover Point trail head to the Runners Trail head.
                            A total of 160 kilometres and 14 trail heads are displayed in this map, zooming into each head and describing the
                            stretch between the current and the next.

                        <p> The second solution that we've developed for this project is a map that uses ArcGIS API for JavaScript to add more custom features. 
                            This includes a legend, navigational controls (pan, rotate, zoom) in a 3D perspective, Changing Base Maps, Location Tracking, custom
                            elevation profiles and expandable widgets for better interface viewing. This solution serves as a self-guided tour to compliment the
                            StoryMap Guided Tour. Overviews of this interface are display below:</p>

                        <h4>Evaluation of addressing Problem Statement</h4>
                        <p>This interactive web-map provides the user with general details of the Vancouver Island Trail. The ability for the user to explore in a 3D environment and with different base 
                            maps gives the user a birdâ€™s eye view experience of the trail which is helpful to acquire a good understanding of the general surroundings. More importantly, the elevation 
                            profile feature provides even more details of the trail should they want to know more technical specifications such as elevation gain and length. All in all, a user is adequately 
                            informed of the Vancouver Island Trail.
                        </p>
                        <p>With that in mind, this application is ideally suited for prospective hikers who require a general understanding of the trail. Actual, on the ground-hikers planning a multi-day 
                            hike can still find use in this application, especially with a location tracker feature and the mobile friendly interface.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is understood that more can be done to improve the effectiveness at informing the user. Firstly, expanding the functionality to include more trail data (such as trail difficulty 
                            level, waypoints, points of interest, boundaries, etc) however that is contingent on the availability of data at the present. Otherwise, more can be done to make the application 
                            more visually appealing and dynamic. Currently, it is full-page map with expandable widgets. Though, this is sufficient for keeping the interface clean, information / data is easier 
                            to interpret when provided in an easy to read format. A future investment could be to find a resolution for custom Pop-ups which would help display tabulated data better.
